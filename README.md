# landing-page-css-foundations
I completed this project as part of the Odin Project's Foundations course. This displays my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

For this project I will be re-creating an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project. 

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors used.
